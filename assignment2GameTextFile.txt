You are Agent Robert, an elite agent who works for a secret organization.
Your objective is to get inside a building and hack a computer with dangerous informations.
Ok, you found a back door with no security and got inside of the building. 
You were fast enough to enter a room without anyone spotting you.
But looks like that the door is locked and you need to solve a charade to discover the door pasword.
The computer says: "What goes up when rain comes down?" 
Enter your answer now: ***umbrella***
Nice job, you found the right word left that room.
You heard steps coming from the hallway  in front of you, so you went upstairs and hid inside a huge vault.
The problem now is that someone just closed it, and you're stuck again. In the end of the vault you found a security pannel.
Even though it is hard to read, you can see that the letters "sapsdorw" are written close to it.
With that, you discover that it might be an anagram. Enter the correct secred word: ***password***
Great job. You managed to open it. And it seems that you were lucky enough to go to the president's floor.
Now you can see your final objective, the main computer. 
But in your way you see powerful lasers.
You were able to hack into the terminal with your phone and need to solve another puzzle to get access to the computer.
It seems that you need to find the missing number. It says: 1+4=5, 2+5=12, 3+6=21, 8+11=?.
Enter the missing number: ***96***
Amazing, you deactivated all the lasers and got inside the room.
Now you need to gain access to the computer, but it will not be easy. Looks like the passowrd can be found following a pattern.
But take care, the computer has an advanced alarm system. 
If you type the wrong answer, there will be dozens of guards surrounding the room. 
The computer says: 5+3+2=151022, 9+2+4=183652, 8+6+3=482466, 5+4+5=202541, 7+2+5=?.
Enter your answer now: 143547
Great job. You managed to get everything we needed.
*You go to the roof and a helicopter comes to take you home*
